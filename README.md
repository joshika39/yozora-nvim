## Features

As I work as a full-stack developer, I have included complete support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Go. I have also included support for other languages, but it is not as complete.

You can work with React, Vue, and Svelte with this config. It also includes support for Django, Flask, and FastAPI.

This config uses Packer as a package manager
